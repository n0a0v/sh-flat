This implementation requires a C++17 compliant compiler and has been tested
with:
	* g++ 12
	* clang 15

CMake & binaries are setup for unit testing. Only the headers in the "sh"
directory are necessary to use the flat map & set implementations. Simply move
them as a group to a desired directory.

sh::flat_map:
	* Like C++23's std::flat_map.
sh::flat_set:
	* Like C++23's std::flat_set.
sh::unordered_flat_map:
	* Similar to C++23's std::flat_map but without the guaranteed ordering.
	* Doesn't use binary search.
	* Uses an std::equal-like comparator instead of std::less-like.
sh::unordered_flat_set:
	* Similar to C++23's std::flat_set but without the guaranteed ordering.
	* Doesn't use binary search.
	* Uses an std::equal-like comparator instead of std::less-like.

I hope this is useful or at least interesting!
